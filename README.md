# Epicode Portfolio - FS0123A - Full Stack Developer Course ðŸ’»

### Within this portfolio you can find all the excercises and the projects that i made for Epicode's course, from January 2023 to June 2023.

### Each week (es. w1) is structured as follows: from d1 to d4 (Monday to Thursday), exercises on different topics are collected, and on d5 (Friday) there is always an end-of-module assessment, usually a more structured exercise that requires the implementation of the various topics covered during the week. 

### The fourth week of each module is always a week where, together with a team of other students, we work on larger and more structured projects to test our teamwork and organizational skills on more complex challenges.
